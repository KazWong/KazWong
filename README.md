# Hi, this is my development playground!

## About
I develop robotics software on embedded system, from verilog on FPGA, bare metal on MCU to ubuntu on nvidia xavier. I play with real robot and simulation robot.

Kaz Wong was a Research and Development Engineer in Robotics within the Robotics and Control team at Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre(LSCM) in Hong Kong, responsible for aspects of designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining the hardware and software to train and run neural network models for Autonomous Mobile Robot(AMR) navigation as well as motion control on various embedded systems. Before that he worked with SAE Magnetics (HK) Ltd., a TDK group company on process automation to their manufacturing line using Mobile Manipulator to achieve industry 4.0. Kaz received his Bachelor Degree in Electronic Engineering for the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

## Projects
### [WIP] Navigation Simulation
This simulation package has been developed for many years, but its documentation is lacking because I planned it for personal use only. I want to publicize my development, and I am working on the documentation.
